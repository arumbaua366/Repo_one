                    Hello, my name is Andrea Rumbaua. I am currently enrolled in the UC Davis Continuing and Professional Education coding bootcamp. I am a full-time employee working in exam development for a public human resources consulting agency.</h3>

                <h1 class="p-2">About</h1> 
                <p class="p-2">We've all heard the figure of speech, "Jack of all trades, master of none." I was one of those people. Nevertheless, even if I couldn't find a passion, I always knew that I wanted to help people in some way. I think that is why I gravitated toward the health-related field during my undergrad years. After graduating, I still felt lost. But one thing I never did was stop learning. With every job I had I sucked up new knowledge, new technology, anything that could help me find what I didn't know I was looking for.</p>

                <p class="p-2">It really wasn't until after college that I really developed an interest in coding. To be perfectly honest, the mobile game Flappy Bird was what really ramped up my interest. I first started playing around with Swift, then watched a few computer science videos on Youtube, and designed some surveys for work using HTML and CSS, among other activities that exposed me to coding. I thought, this feels right; more right than a lot of my past career decisions.</p> 

                <p class="p-2">In the past few months, I have acquired knowledge on Scratch, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Bulma, Node.js, APIs/JSON, and Git/GitHub. I'm still perfecting my knowledge of the previously listed, but am on a continuous quest to learning new programming languages, frameworks, databases, and principles.</p>
